Hi !coach_name

Out of respect to your time I will try to make this as short and concise as possible, below I will list my football/soccer credentials and achievements as well as a short discussion about myself personally and my future and current academic aspirations. 

So if you are in any way interested after you have watched my 4min highlight reel please contact me and i would be more than glad to start some kind of a conversation. 

Football - in sweden
-joined local academy club at 12 years old (IK Sirius, play in allsvenskan)
-got selected to all the distrikt teams trainings and matches, equivalent to a “state team”, ages 14-16

Im 17 years old currently living in Sweden but was born in the UK and grew up in New zealand. I'm half english half swedish. I'm around 175 cm tall (5 foot 9), but my height has never been an issue for me, at least not in football. I grew up playing mainly cb or rb but recently transitioned to cm due to my capability of winning the ball and progressing forward with it. In school I'm regarded as an above average student studying the natural sciences and averaging a B (grade). I tend to really excel in subjects like mathematics but have a harder time with more fact based subjects like chemistry and biology. I know the US vs Swedish school systems are vastly different so I'm not sure how my efforts here would converge but I hope !school_name has an open mind and potentially would want to work something out with me and of course yourself.

Unfortunately I don't have a huge amount of content to choose from but I hope these few clips give you a vague idea of what kind of player I am.

I write this email because the thought of playing football at a high level at the same time as studying at a high level, something that's very important to me, is truly a dream come true. Your program at !school_name is something I would love to take part of, with that said, thank you for your time and most of all your consideration. I would love to hear from you in the near future, Oliver.
